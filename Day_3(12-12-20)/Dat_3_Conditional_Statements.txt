Conditional Statements
    Check a condition, If the condition is satisfied then it returns true.
    If the condition is not satisfied then it returns false.
    
Types:
    if
    if else
    if elif...else
    Nested If

Logical Operators:
    =           Assignment Operator
    ==          Equvalent Operator ( Comparison Operator )
    !=          Not Equal to
    <           lesser than
    >           greater than
    <=          lesser than or Equal to
    >=          greater than or Equal to
    and         AND Gate
    or          OR Gate
    .           Dot Operator

If Condition:
    Helps you to Check a condition, if that condition is satisfied then it returns the true Statements.
    If the condition is not satisfied then it returns nothing.

    Sytax:
        if (condition):
            true_statement

if else Statement
    Helps you to Check a condition, if that condition is satisfied then it returns the true Statements.
    If the condition is not satisfied then it returns the false statement.
    Sytax:
        if (condition):
            true_statement
        else:
            false_statement

Output:
    Enter a number: 24
    24 is an even number

    Enter a number: 15
    15 is an Not an even number

    Read a number
    Divide that number by 2
    Check the reminder is equal to 0.
    If equals to 0 then Print num is an even number
    else Print num is not an even number


    if elif.. else
    Helps you to check more than one condition in a sequential order.
    Syntax:
        if condition 1:
            true_statement 1
        elif condition 2:
            true_statement 2
        .
        .
        .
        .
        else:
            false_statement

        Grade System:
            35 - 50 : C Grade           if condition 1 and condition 2:
            51 - 65 : B Grade               true_statement
            66 - 75 : A Grade 
            76 - 100 : A+
            Other   : Fail

AND Gate: and
    Intersection concept in SETS
    A           B           AB
    1           0           0
    0           1           0
    1           1           1
    0           0           0    

Nested If :
    Having a complete if else inside another if else condition.
Syntax:
    if condition 1:
        if condition 2:
            true_statement condition 2
        else:
            false_statement condition 2
    else:
        false_statement condition 1
