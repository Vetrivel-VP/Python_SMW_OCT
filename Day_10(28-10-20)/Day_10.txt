Exception Handling:
    To handle the run time errors, we use the exception handling concept.

try     : Is a block organise the error code.
except  : Is a block handles that error code.
finaly  : Is a block executed while the error is occured or the error is not occured.

Exception is base class.
    NumberFormatException
    ArithmeticError
    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
    ClassNotFoundException
    SQLError


    Python File Handling:
        open() : Function helps you to open a file.
            Two parameter:
                1st : Location of your file
                2nd : Mode.
        read:
            fileobject
            read()          : Character by character
            readline()      : Line by line
            readlines()     : Entire line and save them as a list


            fileobject : Reads the line by line data as string
            read() : reads a line by line and iterate character by character
            readline() : reads the first line of the file and iterate it character 
                by character
            
            readlines() : reads the entire file as a string.

Use the split()
convert it to the respective datatype
calculate the calucation
save back it to the new file.
