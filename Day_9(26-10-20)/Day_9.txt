Polymorphism:
    In  greek term the word 
        Poly  : Many, 
        morph : Forms or Shapes 
                many forms or many shapes..
            
    A function has a capability to act in more than one form is said to be polymorphism.

    Two Tpyes:
            Compile Time
            Run Time

Compile Time:
    Executed during the compilation time of the program.
    It is achieved by the functin overloading.

Condition for Overloading:
    Function name should same.
    Function parameter or the return statement should be different.

Run time:
    Executed during the Run time of the program.
    It is achieved by the function overriding.

Condition for Overriding.
    Function name should be same.
    Function parameter and the return statement also should be same.
    Parent      child
    First       Second              is-A : Relationship.
    run()         run()


Encapsulation:
    Hiding an implementation details of your class properties..
    By making our class variables as private member we can restrict the user access.

    Private variable are accessible only inside the class not out side the class.
    __ : prefix the variable with double underscore 


Regular Expression: RegEx
    A regEx, is a sequence of a characters that forms a search pattern.
    RegEx can bbe used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

Module:
    Python has built-in package called re, which can be used to work with regualr Expressions.
    import that Module just lik
    import re


    [] : A set of characters                            : "[a-m]"
    \  : Signals a special Sequence                     : "\d"
    .  : ANy character                                  : "he...o"
    ^  : Start with                                     : "^hello"
    $  : End with                                       : "world$"            
    *  : Zero or More occureneces.                      : "aix*"
    +  : One or More Occurences                         : "aix+"        
    {} : Exactly the specified number of Occurences     : "a{2}"
    |  : Either or                                      : "falls|stays"
    () : Capture or a group


    findall()   : Returns a list of containing all matches.
    search()    : Searches the string for match, and return a match object , if there is more than one 
                    occurence it returns the first occurence.   
    split()     : Returns a list where the string has been split at each match.
    sub()       : This replaces the matches with your text of your choices.
